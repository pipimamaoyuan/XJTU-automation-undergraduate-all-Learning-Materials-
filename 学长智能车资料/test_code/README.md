* code4.py and code5.py are used in PC windows, so you can test some parameters in your PC.



* pidRUN.py is a file that I didn't finish, because it is hard for our team to debug the parameters P,I,D. But I believe my logic of the code is right.
  
* TestCamera.py , TestMotor.py , Testpingpong.py , TestPWM.py is run in your Raspberry Pi to test your function is working.
